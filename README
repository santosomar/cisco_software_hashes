1. BulkHash.tar: 
Cisco provided image for which signature is to be verified.

2. BULKHASH-CCO_RELEASE.cer: 
Cisco signed x.509 end-entity certificate containing public key that can be used to 
verify the signature. This certificate is chained to Cisco root posted on 
http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/certs/crcam2.cer

3. BulkHash.tar.signature: 
Signature generated for the image.

4. cisco_x509_verify_release.py : 
Signature verification program. After downloading image, 
its digital signature, and the x.509 certificate, this program can be 
used to verify the 3-tier x.509 certificate chain and signature. Certificate
chain validation is done by verifying the authenticity of end-entity 
certificate using Cisco's SubCA and root CA certificate. Then this authentic
end-entity certificate is used to verify the signature.
